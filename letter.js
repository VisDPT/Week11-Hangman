// //Both letter.js and word.js should be constructor files:
// word.js should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.
// letter.js should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.


// this is your constructor
module.exports = function Letter() {
	this.guess = [];
	
    // do stuff in here for `Letter`
}
